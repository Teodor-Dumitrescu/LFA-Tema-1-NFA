Simulation of a Nondeterministic finite automaton, is a project designed for the Formal and Automatic Languages course,
written in C++ language. The program receives the characteristics of an NFA as input and some words and confirms 
or infirms for each word whether it is or it isnâ€™t accepted by the automaton.
